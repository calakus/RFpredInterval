# RFpredInterval
R package which implements Prediction Intervals with Random Forests and Boosted Forests

`RFpredInterval` package has two main R functions as below.

*    `pibf`: Constructs prediction intervals with **P**rediction **I**ntervals with **B**oosted **F**orests (PIBF)
*    `rfpi`: Constructs prediction intervals with 15 distinct variations to produce **P**rediction **I**ntervals with **R**andom **F**orests (RFPI) proposed by Roy and Larocque (2020)

## Installation
The package can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package. Run the following code in `R` to install:

```R
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}
devtools::install_github('calakus/RFpredInterval')
```
